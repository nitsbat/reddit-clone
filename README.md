# reddit-clone
This project aims to build a reddit clone application using Spring framework at backend and Angular for the front end.
The application starts with a homepage with the header section containing the Login and SignUp button on the right for the user to login.
The user is capable of creating a post once logged in, similarly he/she can comment or upvote/downvote in a particular comment.
To create a post , the user first must create a subreddit.
Eventually we will have the profile option for every user where he/she can see all the posts created by them and also the posts they have
commented.
