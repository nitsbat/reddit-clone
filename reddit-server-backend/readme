After creating the Entity class with their respective data repositories we will be doing some
configuration related to user authentication.
Configurations - we have made a SecurityConfig class under the package config.
In that, we have the configure method which we have overridden from the base class which takes
HttpSecurity as an argument. Here, we are configuring Spring to allow all the requests which
match the endpoint “/api/auth/**” , as these endpoints are used for authentication and registration
we don’t expect the user to be authenticated at that point of time.
PasswordEncoder
Now before storing the user in the database, we ideally want to encode the passwords.
one of the best hashing algorithms for passwords is the Bcrypt Algorithm.
We are using the BCryptPasswordEncoder class provided by Spring Security.

Inside the AuthService class, we are mapping the RegisterRequest object to the User object
 and when setting the password, we are calling the encodePassword() method.
 This method is using the BCryptPasswordEncoder to encode our password.
 After that, we save the user into the database. Note that we are setting the enabled flag as false, as we want to disable the user after registration,
and we only enable the user after verifying the user’s email address.

Now as we can now save the user in the database for authentication but the user should only be given access to the
application if his/her email is verified and hence for this we will first generate the verification token for this just
after saving the user and then we will send this verification token to the email of that particular user and for the email
storage part we would be using a fake SMTP messenger called MAILTRAP.












Our login functionality will use the JWT
